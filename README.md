## Potato Disease Detection System

### 🏠 Project Overview

This project is a deep learning-based solution for detecting diseases in potato plants. By analyzing uploaded images of potato leaves, it identifies potential diseases using a ResNet18 model, which is trained with transfer learning in the PyTorch framework. The system features a Django-based API and a user-friendly web interface developed with HTML and CSS, making it accessible for farmers and agricultural professionals.

### The model is trained to classify images into three classes:

  ✅ Healthy

  ✅ Early Blight

  ✅ Late Blight

### 📷 Key Features

✅ Disease Detection: Upload an image to classify the condition of a potato leaf into one of three classes: Healthy, Early Blight, or Late Blight.

✅ ResNet18 Model: Transfer learning applied to a pre-trained ResNet18 architecture ensures high accuracy.

✅ Web Application: A responsive front-end developed with HTML/CSS provides a seamless user experience.

✅ Django API: The backend serves real-time predictions via a RESTful API.

✅ Efficiency: Optimized workflow for rapid analysis and feedback.

### 📊 Technologies Used

✔ Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch

✔ Model Architecture: ResNet18 with transfer learning

✔ Backend: Django API

✔ Frontend: HTML/CSS for UI

✔ Image Processing: OpenCV (optional preprocessing)

✔ Libraries: Torchvision for loading the pre-trained ResNet18 model

### 🔄 Future Scope

✔ Enhance the model to classify additional potato diseases.

✔ Improve front-end design with better visualization of results.

✔ Deploy the system on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) for scalability.

✔ Integrate with IoT devices for real-time crop monitoring.
